# Network Reconnaissance with Nmap üîç

This repository contains results and analysis from a local network scan using Nmap.
It's part of a Cyber Security Internship assignment.

## üîß Tools Used
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
- Wireshark (Optional)

## üß™ What Was Done
- Identified local IP range using `ipconfig` / `ifconfig`
- Scanned using: `nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24`
- Documented open ports and common services
- Analyzed security implications of the findings

## üìÇ Contents
- `nmap_scan_results.txt`: Output from the TCP SYN scan
- `analysis.md`: Breakdown of open ports and associated risks
- `interview_questions.md`: Prepared answers for interview questions
- `wireshark_summary.md`: Insights from Wireshark (optional)
- `screenshots/`: Visuals of terminal or packet capture (optional)
